Considering the published codes (implemented in class), add the comparisons >, <, >=, <=. To do this, you must add the corresponding Tokens in <RELATIONAL> in the .jj file. Also, change in the .java file (GeradorCodigoDestino), between the current lines 103 to 108, with the insertion of other comparisons (in addition to the == that already exists) and use in each case the ifs: ifge, ifgt or ifle (see details of these opcodes at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_bytecode_instructions&gt;).
